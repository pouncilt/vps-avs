Below are the steps involved in creating an Application Proxy User.  I'm assuming a name for this particular Application Proxy to be "AVS,PROXY".

1.  Add "AVS,PROXY" to the NEW PERSON file (#200) as the unique name of the AVS Application Proxy User.

2.  Set the USER CLASS field (#9.5) in the NEW PERSON file (#200) to "Application Proxy" for the AVS,PROXY Application Proxy User.

3.  Assign the OR CPRS GUI CHART and DVBA CAPRI GUI menu options as the "B"-type Secondary menu options to the AVS,PROXY Application Proxy User.

4.  Set the APP PROXY ALLOWED field (#.11) in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994) to "YES" for each of the following RPCs executed by the AVS,PROXY Application Proxy User:

SC LISTER
XWB GET VARIABLE VALUE

Additionally, the Kernel Developer Guide contains the following criteria for creating an Application Proxy User:

- The name added to the NEW PERSON file (#200) must be unique. 

- It must have a user class of "Application Proxy," as defined in the USER CLASS file (#201) and pointed to by the USER CLASS field (#9.5) in the NEW PERSON file (#200). 

- It must not have an Access or Verify code assigned to it. 

- It must not have a Primary menu assigned to it. 

- It must have one or more Secondary menu options assigned to it. 

- The RPCs that the menu options reference must have the APP PROXY ALLOWED field (#.11) in the REMOTE PROCEDURE file (#8994) set to YES.
