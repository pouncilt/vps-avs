<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10">As many patients and clinicians have experienced, patients tend to forget most of what they are told during outpatient visits. &nbsp;In fact, patients forget 40% to 80% of the information from healthcare providers. &nbsp; Of what patients do remember, they remember about half incorrectly</span><span class="rvts14">1</span><span class="rvts10"> and the more information they are given, the less they remember</span><span class="rvts14">2</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp;Moreover, patients desire more information than they typically receive about their illnesses and treatment plan</span><span class="rvts14">3</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; Poor retention of the treatment plan leads to non-adherence, medication errors, missed appointments and perceptions of miscommunication with the provider.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10">Clinical summaries of outpatient visits are a means to provide patients with the information they need after a visit with their healthcare provider</span><span class="rvts14">4</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; The federal government recognizes the importance of this form of communication since the clinical summary, known as the After Visit Summary (AVS), is part of the meaningful use criteria that determines reimbursements for electronic health record implementation to physicians and hospitals.</span><span class="rvts14">5,6</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp; &nbsp;The Veterans Administration (VA) has committed to seeking meaningful use certification of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) through its open source software development and an AVS would be needed to meet that certification</span><span class="rvts14">7</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; What is currently available as an AVS through VistA and the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) is not adequate due terminology and formats that are neither patient-centered or patient-friendly. </span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10">In previous studies, a printed AVS has been shown to enhance patient trust and confidence in their physician</span><span class="rvts14">8</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;and contribute to patient satisfaction.</span><span class="rvts14">5</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;Despite the fact that combining oral and written information is more effective than using either oral or written information alone</span><span class="rvts14">9</span><span class="rvts10">, &nbsp; a printed AVS may be be anachronous to the trend towards electronic health records. &nbsp;Personal Health Records (PHR’s) provide patients with electronic access to their health record and may increase patients' engagement in their healthcare</span><span class="rvts14">10</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; However, while the use of PHR’s is increasing not all patients have access to them. &nbsp;In fact, most veterans have not registered for the VA’s MyHealtheVet website and of those who have, only about 25% have full access to their records to include progress notes, prescriptions, secure messaging and other personal health information</span><span class="rvts14">11</span><span class="rvts10">. &nbsp; Even when patients have access to a PHR, &nbsp;patients access the AVS more frequently that other information available to them.</span><span class="rvts14">12</span><span class="rvts10"> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10"><br></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts10">The AVS has been selected by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Innovations Selection Board and approved by the Veterans Administration (VA) Undersecretary for Health to be funded for national deployment. &nbsp;The VA Healthcare System Informatics Team is working closely with the VA’s Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) program on national deployment including uploading the AVS to MyHealtheVet (MHV) and MHV Secure Messaging. &nbsp;This manual provides instructions for the use of the current version of the AVS. &nbsp;</span></p>
