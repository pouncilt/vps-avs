/**
 * @author Rob Durkin
 * 
 * A general-purpose logging facility. This is a base class from which an actual
 * implementation is derived.  It only defines how log message are written
 * by a client.  Where the log message is written and the mechanism for
 * controlling logging is left up to the implementation.  This class does
 * not define any of these mechanism and their definition is not necessary
 * for understand how to use this class.
 *
 * Each log message is associate with a facility and has a level assigned
 * to it.  A facility is a symbolic (String) name that defines a class of
 * log messages.  The levels are similar to the UNIX syslog functionality. 
 *
 * It is expected that the implementation can enable, disable and
 * direct log messages based on these attributes.  Facilities and levels
 * are defined symbolicly, with no restriction on the name, and form a tuple.
 * Several standard levels are defined as integer constants and their use
 * is expected to be higher performing than symbolic levels..
 *
 * Normally, a single,global instance of the object
 * exists and is obtainable by a static method in this class.
 *
 * Log messages are written via an object implementing LogChannel.
 * A channel is associated with a single facility, with the level being
 * specified when a message is written.  Normally, a LogChannel
 * is obtained once at initialization time and use repeatedly.  It is
 * permissible to obtain multiple references to the log channel for a facility,
 * but this is discouraged for performance reasons.
 *
 * Log messages, even debugging ones, should be defined with care.  They
 * should be terse, but clear to someone who isn't intimately familiar with
 * the code.  Permanent debugging messages should be designed with the idea
 * of use when supporting a deployed product.
 *
 * The central logging object needs to be configured very early in the startup
 * process.  If logging can't be configured, then the startup should be aborted
 * or an object created that does some simple form of logging, such as write
 * to stderr.  A client should never have to check if the global logger object exists.
